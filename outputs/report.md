Bell's theorem, formulated by John Stewart Bell in 1964, demonstrates that quantum mechanics predicts stronger statistical correlations between spatially separated measurements than any local hidden-variable theory could. This stems from the EPR paradox and challenges classical intuitions of locality and realism. Experiments have repeatedly confirmed quantum mechanical predictions, violating Bell inequalities and demonstrating non-local correlations between entangled particles. This has profound implications for quantum information science and technology.
