Bell's theorem, formulated by John Stewart Bell in 1964, provided a testable prediction distinguishing quantum entanglement from local hidden variable theories. The theorem, based on Bell inequalities, demonstrated that quantum mechanics predicts stronger statistical correlations in measurements of entangled particles than any local realistic theory could. Subsequent experiments, starting with those by John Clauser and Alain Aspect in the 1970s and 1980s, confirmed quantum predictions by violating Bell inequalities, solidifying entanglement as a real and non-local feature of nature. This work was recognized by the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Clauser, Aspect, and Zeilinger. The discovery challenged the principle of locality, which states that an object can be influenced only by its immediate surroundings, and demonstrated that quantum entanglement allows for instantaneous correlations between separated particles, regardless of distance. This has profound implications for quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography. Local realism, the combination of locality and realism, was challenged by these findings, suggesting that properties of objects may not be definite until measured, and that the universe may not be as intuitively ordered as previously believed.
